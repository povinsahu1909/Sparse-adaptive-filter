# Sparse-adaptive-filter

In real world we encounter impulsive noise which generally are sparse in nature that they have meaningful content only for few moment. This project proposes a techniques of Sparse Adaptive Filter for acoustic impulse signal/noises. As these type of noises cannot be filtered out using normal filter and if can be filter out then they are not computationally efficient. To overcome this limitation, this paper present adaptive filter for sparse systems, which will help to filter out the impulsive noise in efficient manner. Our focus in primary focus is through this paper is to come up with new sparsity aware filter
which converges much faster has much better steady state MSE. Secondly, combining the filter with other class of adaptive filter which will achieve robustness against inpulsive interference. Experiments result were shown which compares the performance of the proposed filter to the available filters in terms of both convergence rate and steady rate.
